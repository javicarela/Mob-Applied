# Conclusions

Recursive partitioning techniques have allowed us to increase the quality of the more classical models such as the generalized linear model or the Logit. Of course, this kind of Techniques do not act as substitutes for these, but, when combined, they allow to fit  more efficient models according to each of the partitioning regions that they define.


**Regarding the selection of partitioning variables**, we have seen how it is not  highly recommended to include variables with many categories, since that causes it to increase exponentially the execution time and not necessarily the quality of the resulting model.


**Regarding the study of the nature of the response variable,** and its possible categorization, it has been proven that it is useful to perform a previous cluster analysis, to check if there are any internal grouping structures that enables to have groups of companies more homogeneous.


It can be concluded that **macroeconomic variables** such as the *Public deficit* (BudgetB) or the *Unemployment rate* (Unemploy) **have been the most appropriate to segment the set** of Business. These results are consistent with the concepts of systematic risk and portfolio diversification.


When triying to **predict the probability associated with each node**, it has been tried to, the variables stand out accountants, **individuals of each company**. *Total assets* (AsstT), *the standard deviation as volatility indicator* (St) and *profit margin* (Pmargin) have been found to be the most significant.
